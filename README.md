# IoT_project_for_motion_detection_and_capturing
Developed a Raspberry Pi-based project for real-time distance measurement and security monitoring using ultrasonic sensors and a camera. The project's primary objectives included:
- Distance Measurement: Implemented distance measurement functionality using an ultrasonic sensor. The system accurately calculated the distance of objects from the sensor, making it suitable for various applications.
- Security Monitoring: Enhanced the project to serve as a security monitoring system. When an object was detected within a predefined "danger zone" (less than or equal to 20 cm), the system activated a camera to record video for security purposes.
- GPIO Control: Utilized the RPi.GPIO library to efficiently manage the Raspberry Pi's General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins for sensor and LED control.
- Camera Integration: Integrated the picamera library to control the Raspberry Pi camera module. This enabled the system to capture video recordings when necessary.
- User-Interface Indication: Incorporated an LED indicator to visually alert users when an object entered the danger zone, enhancing user interaction and system feedback.
