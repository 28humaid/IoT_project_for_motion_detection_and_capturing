# IoT_project_for_motion_detection_and_capturing
I was the team leader for this project, team size was of three members.
This project was done to check for any motion or presence of an object/person within danger limit. If anything came too close i.e. within the danger range, then its video was recorded and saved to drive.
here is the link for the images, video and project report of the project : [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lhnP4C16JcdJkAuh-egfbUI9v1YDby_1?usp=sharing]
